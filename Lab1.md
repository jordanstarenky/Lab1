# Introduce GGplot

``` r
ggplot(datasaurus_dozen, aes(x = x, y = y, colour = dataset))+
    geom_point() + facet_wrap(~dataset)
```

``` r

ggplot(dino, aes(x = x, y = y))+
  geom_point (color="#FF13F0") + theme_void() + labs(title = "Hi, I'm a dino!") + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 20, color = "pink"))

# Q1: What is the function of facet wrap? In what situation do you think you will use this function?

# Q2: The means, standard deviations, and correlations are pretty much the same, but the data pattern looks very different for each dataset. What is the implication here?
